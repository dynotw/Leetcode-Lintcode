450. Delete Node in a BST
Medium


Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.



# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right


# This problem really need to read the Solution, which explain very clearly
# Time Complexity: O(log N); Space Complexity: O(logN). In BST, H = logN
