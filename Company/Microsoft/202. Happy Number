202. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
  1. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
  2. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
  3. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
  4. Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 

Example 1:
Input: n = 19
Output: true

Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1



class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        one = n
        two = n
        while(1):
            one = self.helper(one)
            two = self.helper(self.helper(two))
            
            if(one == two):
              break
        
        return(two == 1)
    
    def helper(self, n):
        num = 0 
        while(n):
            num = num + (n%10) ** 2
            n = n//10
        
        return num
