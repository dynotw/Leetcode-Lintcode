Hard

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
 

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')



# Use DP
# Time complexity: O(mn); Space complexity: O(mn)
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        dp = [[0]*(len(word2)+1) for i in range(len(word1)+1)]
        print(dp)
        
        # initialize dp
        for i in range(len(word1)+1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for j in range(len(word2)+1):
            dp[0][j] = j
        
        for i in range(1, len(word1)+1):
            for j in range(1, len(word2)+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i][j-1],dp[i-1][j]) + 1
        
        return dp[-1][-1]
