465. Optimal Account Balancing
Hard

You are given an array of transactions transactions where transactions[i] = [fromi, toi, amounti] 
indicates that the person with ID = fromi gave amounti $ to the person with ID = toi.

Return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

 

Example 1:
Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[2,0,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.

Example 2:
Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[1,0,1],[1,2,5],[2,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.





# Use DFS
# Starting from first debt debt[0], we look for all other debts debt[i] (i>0) which have opposite sign to debt[0]. 
# Then each such debt[i] can make one transaction debt[i] += debt[0] to clear the person with debt debt[0]. 
# From now on, the person with debt debt[0] is dropped out of the problem and 
# we recursively drop persons one by one until everyone's debt is cleared meanwhile updating the minimum number of transactions during DFS.
