49. Group Anagrams
Medium

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 
Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Example 2:
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3：
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]




# Time complexity: O(n*klogk); sapce complexity: O(n)
# We can optimize sort, by kinds of collections.Counter method, see method 2
# We can't use collections.Counter directly, because Counter is hashtable type, it can't be used as key in dictionary.

        for i in word:

        return tuple(count)
