1631. Path With Minimum Effort
Medium


You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, 
where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), 
and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, 
and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

 

Example 1:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],
                  [3,8,2],
                  [5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.

Example 2:
Input: heights = [[1,2,3],
                  [3,8,4],
                  [5,3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].

Example 3:
Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],
                  [1,2,1,2,1],
                  [1,2,1,2,1],
                  [1,2,1,2,1],
                  [1,1,1,2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: This route does not require any effort.




# it can't be solved by DP
# Because the hiker can go in all four directions. This means that a dp algorithm would need to look into subproblems that haven't been solved yet.
# Use BFS + Binary Search: binary search is to go through all possible results, BFS is to check whether specific result is valid


# Time complexity: O(m*n); Space Complexity: O(m*n)
