14. Longest Common Prefix
Easy


Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.



# Time complexity: O(m*n); Space complexity: O(1)
import sys
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        if strs == None or len(strs) == 0:
            return ""
        
        minSize = sys.maxsize
        index = -1
        for i in strs:
            minSize = min(minSize, len(i))
        
        end = minSize
        for index in range(minSize):
            temp = strs[0][index]
            
            for i in strs:
                if i[index] == temp:
                    continue
                else:
                    end = index
                    break
            
            # end != minSize, represents that we run else statement in inner for loop, so we need to stop outer loop
            if end != minSize:
                break

        return strs[0][:end]
