82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
Medium

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next


# Remove all duplicated element, instead of keeping one 
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        
        # sentinel
        sentinel = ListNode()
        sentinel.next = head

        # predecessor = the last node 
        # before the sublist of duplicates
        pred = sentinel
        
        while head:
            # if it's a beginning of duplicates sublist 
            # skip all duplicates
            if head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
                # move till the end of duplicates sublist
                while head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
                    head = head.next
                # skip all duplicates
                pred.next = head.next 
            # otherwise, move predecessor
            else:
                pred = pred.next 
                
            # move forward
            head = head.next
            
        return sentinel.next
