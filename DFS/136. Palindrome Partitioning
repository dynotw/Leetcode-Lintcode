136. Palindrome Partitioning
中文English
Given a string s. Partition s such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

Example
Example 1:

Input: "a"
Output: [["a"]]
Explanation: Only 1 char in the string, only 1 way to split it (itself).
Example 2:

Input: "aab"
Output: [["aa", "b"], ["a", "a", "b"]]
Explanation: There are 2 ways to split "aab".
    1. Split "aab" into "aa" and "b", both palindrome.
    2. Split "aab" into "a", "a", and "b", all palindrome.
Notice
Different partitionings can be in any order.
Each substring must be a continuous segment of s.
