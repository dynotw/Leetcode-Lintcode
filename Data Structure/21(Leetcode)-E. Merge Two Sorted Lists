21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4



# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# time: O(m+n); space: O(1)
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        head = dummy
        
        while(l1 and l2):

            if(l1.val <= l2.val):
                head.next = l1
                head = head.next
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                head.next = l2
                head = head.next
                l2 = l2.next

        
        while(l1):
                head.next = l1
                head = head.next
                l1 = l1.next
        while(l2):
                head.next = l2
                head = head.next
                l2 = l2.next
        
        return dummy.next
