Question:
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:
The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.

Example:
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]




Answer:
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        
        # for i in nums2:
        #     nums1.append(i)
        
        x = m
        for i in nums2:
            nums1[x] = i
            x += 1
        nums1.sort()
